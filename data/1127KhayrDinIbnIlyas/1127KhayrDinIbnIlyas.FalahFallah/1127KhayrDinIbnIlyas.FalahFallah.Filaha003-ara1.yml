90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Converted from HTML at filaha.org, which is a
        transcription of manuscript No. 894, King Saud University Library,
        Riyadh. The transcriber is not named there. Perhaps the transcription is
        taken from the edition/transcription prepared by Adīb ʿUmar al-Ḥuṣarī
        (http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48047699), but I have not been able to
        check this.
        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): PARATEXT added.
    All paratextual elements
